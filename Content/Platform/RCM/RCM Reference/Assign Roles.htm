        <p class="Body">You assign roles to a group in exactly the same way as you assign roles to a user (see <MadCap:xref href="Assign Roles per Business.htm#_Ref85789902" class="ParaTextOnly">Assign Roles per Business Units</MadCap:xref>). All users that belong to this group inherit the roles that are assigned to this group (plus all roles that are directly assigned to that user). This feature enables you to define a group of users and then assign a role once to the group rather than assigning the required role to each user independently.</p>
