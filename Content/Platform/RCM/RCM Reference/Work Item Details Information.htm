        <p class="Body">The information available within the Work Item Details page depends on the type of solution that was run and the requirements of your organization. Typically there is a work item heading section that provides a summary about the entity on which the work item was generated, and additional specific information that is appropriate for the work item type of this work item.</p>
        <p class="Body">When more information exists, this information may be presented under tabs or bars within the details page. When additional information is available, there will be an icon that indicates this, for example a <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Work Item Details Information.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 9px;height: 9px;" alt="row_expended" /> plus sign at the end of the bar.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Work Item Details page may be enriched with audit history, notes or links that enable you to drill down to more details. </p>
        <p class="Body">For a detailed explanation about the work items details for the solution that you are working with, refer to the available documentation for that solution.</p>
