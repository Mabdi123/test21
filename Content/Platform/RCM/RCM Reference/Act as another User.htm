        <p class="SubHeading">Two Step Delegation Chains</p>
        <p class="Body">A two step chain delegation is when a user changes the user credentials via the User Context application link and then changes it again to a third user.</p>
        <div class="Note">This feature is available only to users that have been provided with the relevant permissions and delegations by the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> administrator. For details on delegation, substitution and acting as another user, see <MadCap:xref href="Application Links and Options.htm#_Toc489949317"> Application Links and Options</MadCap:xref> .</div>
        <p class="Body">The following two step delegation chains are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A user that is in substituting mode can act as another user. <br />For example:<br />user 10 substitutes for user 11 and then acts as user 12.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>A user that is currently acting as another user can substitute for another user.<br />For example:<br />user 10 acts as user 11 and then substitutes for user 12. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Note that in all types of two step chain delegations the upper right corner of the screen indicates the name of the users whose credentials are used. A related icon also appears with the tooltip that provides details on this session:</p>
