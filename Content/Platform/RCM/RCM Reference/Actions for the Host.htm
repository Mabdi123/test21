        <h4 class="NoNumber">Common Rules</h4>
        <p class="Body">Common Rules are generated by the host and are universal for all tenants. The host enables tenants to use the rules by activating them (i.e., before they are activated they are kept as a draft only by the host). </p>
        <p class="Body">The host can define whether or not each rule (i.e., common rule) should be activated by the tenants (the rules that should be activated are referred to as recommended rules). When a new tenant logs in to the Policy Manager they will be able to view all the common rules that the host activated. The tenant can change the host recommendation by deactivating a recommended rule or activating a rule that was not recommended by the host. The tenant can also add their own unique rules,</p>
        <p class="Body">To mark a rule as common the host needs to define the rule as <span class="Strong">Activate.</span></p>
        <p class="Body">The Rule is defined <span class="Strong">Activate as default </span>when the host wants a rule to be a recommended part of the tenant’s library of rules.&#160; </p>
        <p class="Body">The rule is defined <span class="Strong">Don’t activate as default</span> when the host decides that this rule is not recommended for the tenants.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">The host has the ability to define priority rules (including their order) while the tenant does not have this capability.</p>
            <p class="Body">Only the host has the capability to define Test Rules (vs. Production Rules) while the tenant does not have this capability.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">Export/import Rule and Activate Policy are host only actions.</p>
        <p class="Body">All the host actions are found in the <span class="Strong">More actions</span> drop-down menu.</p>

        <p class="Body">The following table illustrates the host’s actions on rules and their effect on the tenants:</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">This behavior answers the need for the host to create a set of rules to be used by tenants that do not need to modify their solution, while providing flexibility for the tenants to use additional rules (library rules). <br />When the host changes one of the common rules from Activate to Do not activate the rule is dropped from all the tenants activation requests for the next activation, and is no longer accessible by the tenants.</p>
