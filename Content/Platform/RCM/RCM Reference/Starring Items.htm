        <h1><a name="_Toc489949385"></a>Starred Items</h1>
        <p class="Body">From the work items list, specific items can be starred. This is useful for easily finding the desired items and performing batch actions on them.</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">Starring is personal, that is, only you see them on the items you starred. Starring is persistent, even across sessions, and will be displayed to you in the work items list until you remove them.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Starring Items.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 653px;height: 243px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">Particularly if the starred items span multiple pages of the view, it is convenient to use the <span class="Strong">Advanced Filter</span> icon (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Starring Items_1.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 25px;height: 16px;" />) and select <span class="Strong">Show Starred Items</span> from the menu to display only the starred items.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Starring Items_2.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 415px;height: 174px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">It is then easy to select the relevant rows from among the starred items and perform an action on them as a batch. When viewing a filtered page that shows only the starred items, you can return to the full list of work items by using the <span class="Strong">Advanced Filter</span> icon again and selecting <span class="Strong">Show All Items</span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="Strong">Advanced Filter</span> window also has a <span class="Strong">Starred Item</span> drop-down menu. This can be used to combine the advanced search with the fact that the result must include or exclude starred items, if necessary.</p>
        <p class="Body">When working with an individual work item, the Work Item Details page has a star in the header that can be selected to mark the item as a starred item, or remove the star if the item was already starred.</p>
        <p class="Body">Example:</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Starring Items_3.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 406px;height: 31px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">Starred items are saved, even after logging out. As there is a maximum number of allowed starred items, you need to deselect the stars from items that are no longer required. If you exceed the maximum number of allowed stars, the system will remove deleted and archived items from the starred items list to free up more stars but, if there are none, you will not be able to star more items until you deselect some starred items.</p>
