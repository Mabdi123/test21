        <p class="Body">Some organizations require distributing the user admin workload across multiple local administrators who have control over users within their department. Local administrators are able to manage only users within their own departments and have no user admin privileges in other departments.</p>

            <li><span class="Strong">Global administrator:</span> Has control of all user administration objects in the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> and can function as a backup to the local administrator. This administrator can perform all actions on roles, users and groups. </li>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Local administrator</span>: this user can add, change and delete users and groups assigned to departments under their responsibility only. The roles are maintained by global administrators only and the local admin can only associate them only to their users/groups, and only if they are related to the department that is their responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Department</span>: Department is the smaller unit for which one or more local administrations can be assigned. A department is a collection of BUs, users, groups and their attributes like their associated roles.
