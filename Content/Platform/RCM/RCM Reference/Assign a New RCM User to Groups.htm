        <p class="Body">Once all required user details are entered, click <span class="Strong">Next</span> to add the user details to the list of users and move to the next page in the wizard.</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">Selecting <span class="Strong">Next</span> within the first page of the wizard saves the new user details to the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> database. If you do not want to save the details, you must select <span class="Strong">Cancel</span> within the first status.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">The second page in the wizard enables you to assign this user to one or more <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> groups. All <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> groups that are defined for use within your organization appear within the list box on the left side of the window. (LDAP groups do not appear when you assign users to groups). Assigning a user to groups enables an administrator to set up and edit permissions for an entire group rather than dealing with each individual user.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can assign one or more group(s) to each user by clicking on the group name(s) and clicking on the appropriate arrow to move this group into the list box on the right side. You can change the group assignment later by clicking on the <span class="Strong">Change Group</span> link within the Manage User activity bar.</p>
        <p class="Body">Once you have completed assigning groups to this user, click <span class="Strong">Save</span> to accept all group assignments for this user.</p>
