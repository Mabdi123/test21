        <h1><a name="_Toc489949470"></a>List of Hierarchy Fields</h1>
        <p class="Body">To understand Risk Based Reviewing, you should initially know the term <span class="Strong">list of hierarchy fields</span>. This term is illustrated in the following example.</p>
        <p class="Body">A Blotter Type has an associated trade type, which has the following custom fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Product Type (e.g. “Equity”, “Fixed Income” or “Futures”)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Trader (e.g. “John Doe”, “Silvia Rosner”, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Product (e.g. “MSFT”, “IBM”, “GOOG”, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">A three level hierarchy is then defined and is composed of the following levels: </p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Product Type</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Trader</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Product</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body">The following is an illustration of the three level hierarchy:</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">List of hierarchy fields is regarded as a specific node in a level and all of its sub nodes. Therefore, “Equity <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span>John Doe <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span> all of his trades” may be defined as a specific list of hierarchy fields.</p>
