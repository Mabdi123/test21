        <p class="Body">Click the Assign Groups to Group link to open the Assign Groups to Group window, which enables you to change assignments of other groups to the selected group.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Assign Groups to Group window only displays groups currently defined within the system (and does not display user names). Note that when you assign a group to a group, the child group inherits all roles that are assigned to the parent group.</p>
