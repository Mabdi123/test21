        <p class="Body">An outgoing form enables you to complete regulatory forms that can later be filed to a regulatory agency. For example, a SAR or CTR form may be filled in and then filed to FinCEN in accordance with this regulatory agency’s rules and regulations. Your organization may also provide you with customized forms that may be used as questionnaires and other user input.</p>

            <p class="Body">The license for this feature is purchased separately.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">Select one case from the Cases List, click the <span class="Strong">Forms tab </span>and click <span class="Strong">Add</span> to begin the process of creating a new form used to generate a report that is sent to a third party.</p>
        <p class="Body">RCM includes the forms options within the Cases module, enabling users to fill out forms.</p>

        <h4 class="NoNumber">Form Creation and Report Generation Flow</h4>
        <p class="Body">Once a form has been created, it may be saved for further editing. After the user completes a form, then the RCM generates a transferable format of the form in order to transfer it or report it to the appropriate agencies (for example, US FinCEN efile). </p>
        <h4 class="NoNumber">Forms Steps</h4>
        <p class="Body">The step of the each form is updated based on where the form is in the form creation/report generation process. </p>
        <p class="Body">The following describe the possible form steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">In process</span> – This is the default step of the form once it is created. In this step, the form may be edited and is not used to generate a report.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Ready for report</span> – This step indicates that the form is ready to be reported. The form cannot be edited while in this step unless it is reverted back to the In process step by opening the form and clicking <span class="Strong">Reclaim</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Reported pending</span> – Once a reportable form is generated, the RCM changes the step to Reported pending. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Reported - success,</span> <span class="Strong">Reported failed</span> – After E-files for forms are sent to the third-party organization, a response should be received from that organization that indicates whether the submission was successful or failed. Once information about the filed forms is received and updated (based on the process that is supported within your organization) the form step is automatically updated within the RCM. </li>
        </ul>
