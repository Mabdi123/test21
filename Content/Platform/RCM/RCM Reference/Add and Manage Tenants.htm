        <p class="Body">In order to gain access to the Tenants Management tab you must assign the user the relevant role. </p>
        <p class="Procedure">To activate Tenant Management:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Click the Manage Roles bar and click <span class="Strong">Add Role</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>In the Modules tab select the <span class="Strong">Tenants Management</span> checkbox to allow the user to access the Tenant Management tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Click the <span class="Strong">Tenants Management </span>tab. The Tenants table appears. A built in Tenant by the name of Host is already in the table. This is the built in Tenant that cannot be removed/updated. Its identifier is always –1. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body">Initially, as the administrator you are not linked to a Tenant and therefore you cannot view any segmented data that is linked to a Tenant. Segmented data is all the data that is attached to a specific Business Unit (Work Items, Cases, Blotters, Reports, DDQ, etc.). The administrator without a Tenant can only view the common data, which is the data in the Admin tab, References, Admin site (Admin.jsp), and all the data in the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> Designer.</p>
