        <p class="Body">You may have the option to jump to another data source when there is linked data of two or more data source fields (the same business type). This linkage is defined by the administrator and may not be available in all data sources. You can view this link when the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Jump to another Data Source.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 15px;height: 18px;" /> icon next to the column heading appears. When you click on a specific cell of the query results table, <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" />opens a menu where you have two options to jump to the other data source:</p>
        <p class="Procedure">To jump to another data source:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Jump to the other data source according to the mutual field data of the focused cell (trade type is A). In this scenario the match is done according to the mutual field (according to the business type) of the data source</li>
            <p class="Body">
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Jump to another Data Source_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Jump to the other data source according to similar records. This option provides one or more mutual fields of the other data source according to the record in focus.</li>
            <p class="Body">
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Jump to another Data Source_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">When performing this jump, mutual conditions from the original data sources are also moved to the other data source query. For example, the period of the original data source is moved to be part of the conditions for the linked data source.</p>
