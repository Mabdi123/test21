        <p class="Body">A sub query is a query that is embedded inside another (parent) query and is used as a part of a condition on a specific column. The sub query that is selected is a query that has been previously saved. </p>
        <p class="Procedure">To create a sub query:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>In the condition operator drop-down, select <span class="Strong">In Sub Query</span> as the filter for the condition. This action opens another drop-down menu.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Select one of the saved queries for this Data Source file as the sub query and apply the condition.</li>

            <p class="Body">It is possible to select sub queries from other data sources as long as you have linked the relevant data sources via the business types and have the required permissions to use these data sources.
