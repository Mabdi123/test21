        <p class="Body">Work items linked to Trades (transactions) always require full review and disposition. Optionally, you may be required to review every single trade or, for some configurations, it is possible to require you to demonstrate review for trades according to their risk score. Both review requirements are defined by your organization’s policy.</p>
        <p class="Body">When Risk Based Trade Review is enabled, you must specifically review individual Trades based on your organization’s policy for one or more of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual Trades containing a risk score above the organization’s defined threshold. You are required to demonstrate review on each such Trade.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Groups of Trades of the same product type above the organization’s defined threshold. If the average risk score for a particular product type exceeds the defined threshold, then you are required to demonstrate review on each Trade of that product type.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Groups of Trades under the same product classification or other hierarchical grouping of product types. If the average risk score for any level of hierarchical product classification exceeds the threshold, then you are required to demonstrate review for all Trades contained within, regardless of their individual risk score.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">When enabled, you have the option to navigate down the product hierarchy. At each level in the hierarchy you are presented with the name of the classification grouping, the average risk score, and the number of Trades that are contained under it. Those classifications or product types that exceed the configuration threshold and require you to explicitly demonstrate reviews are clearly highlighted.

        <p class="Body">Note that you continue to have the ability to review, comment on, and flag the full set of individual Trades by drilling down directly from the Blotter summary. For more information on reviewing Trades refer to the <MadCap:xref href="Review.htm#_Ref435458702" class="ParaTextOnly">Review</MadCap:xref> action.</p>
