        <p class="Body">Once you have finished creating the Draft Policy, you can activate it.</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">Before activating a Draft policy, verify that at least one rule has been set to ‘to be activated’. Otherwise, an error message appears indicating that no rules have been set for activation.</p>

        <ol start="1">
            <li>Click the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Activate a Draft Policy The.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 70px;height: 20px;" /> icon on the bottom of the window.</li>
            <p class="Body">The <span class="Strong">Policy Activation</span> tab displays the list of rules that are to be activated. </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">

            <p class="Body">The Policy Activation table includes the column Activation Diff that provides the following <span class="Strong">states</span> for each rule:</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>New - a new rule for this policy</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed – a rule that has been changed for this policy.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unchanged – a rule that has not been changed for this policy. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deactivated - a rule that has been deactivated for this policy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="Body">Note that this tab also has filtering mechanism. You can use this feature by clicking the <span class="Strong">Filter </span>icon. For details, see <MadCap:xref href="Filter a Rule.htm#_Ref231198623" class="ParaTextOnly">Filter a Rule</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>The <span class="Strong">Policy Activation</span> tab name switches to <span class="Strong">Pending Policy</span>. Once the policy is activated the name of the tab switches back to <span class="Strong">Policy Activation</span>.</li>
            <li>A message also appears indicating that a policy activation request is pending.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Activate a Draft Policy The_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 489px;height: 31px;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-width: 1pt;" /><br />Click the <span class="Strong">here</span> link to view the content of the policy.</li>
            <li>The Actimize Intelligence Server (AIS) must now process the rules of the policy. The interval for this procedure depends on the organization’s configuration of the AIS. Note that during this interval you cannot modify the Draft Policy. If you would like to modify the Draft policy then you must cancel the activation request by clicking the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Activate a Draft Policy The_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /> icon that appears on the screen. To check that the policy is now active, click the <span class="Strong">Active Policy </span>tab. It is recommended to refresh the data on this web page by pressing the <span class="Strong">F5 </span>key. </li>
            <li>The rules of the Active policy appear on this window. If the rules do not appear on window then click on the <span class="Strong">Activation History</span> icon to view the status of this activation. For details, see <MadCap:xref href="Historical Policies Tab History.htm#_Ref205543514" class="ParaTextOnly">Historical Policies Tab - History of Activated Policies</MadCap:xref>.</li>
