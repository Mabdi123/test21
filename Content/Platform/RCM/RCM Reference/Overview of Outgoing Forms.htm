        <p class="Body">The Outgoing Forms module provides a list of all the forms that have been added to cases. It enables you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review the available forms including their dates, status and owners</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly filter and sort the outgoing forms in order to find specific forms</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Easily identify forms’ amendments</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Jump to the form’s related cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Print, export and show a form as a PDF</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Outgoing forms are usually regulatory forms that can be filled in and later filed to a regulatory agency. Your organization may also provide you with customized forms that may be used as questionnaires and other user input. </p>
