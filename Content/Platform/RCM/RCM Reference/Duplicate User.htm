        <p class="Body">Click the <span class="Strong">Duplicate User</span> link within the User Management activity bar to open the Create User window that enables you to quickly create a user with the same reference data (roles and groups) as the original user. The Create User Window indicates the name of the user that this duplicated user is based on. A login name, identifier, and full name must be filled in for this duplicated user.</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">The duplicated user may be linked to a different business unit than that of the original user.</p>
