        <p class="Body">Click the <span class="Strong">Assign Roles</span> link for a selected user opens the Assign Roles per Business Unit to User/Group window. This window enables the administrator to assign roles to a user. These roles determine the permissions for the views that are available for the selected user and the actions that this user can perform. </p>
        <p class="Body">Roles are defined using the options available within the Manage Roles Activity bar (see <MadCap:xref href="Manage Roles.htm#_Ref85888192" class="ParaTextOnly">Manage Roles</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p class="Body">A user may be assigned roles directly (using this <span class="Strong">Assign Roles</span> link) or may be assigned to one or more groups, in which case the user inherits the permissions that are assigned to those groups. (These roles do not appear within the User Roles column within the list of users.)</p>
        <p class="Body">When a role includes permission for work items or reports, this role must always be assigned to a user in association with a business unit. When a role stipulates permissions that do not refer to work items or reports, this role may not be associated with a business unit. </p>
        <p class="Body">Whenever a role is assigned to a user, you must select one of the following options from the In Business Unit drop-down list:</p>
