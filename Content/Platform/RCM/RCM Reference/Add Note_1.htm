        <p class="Body">Select one or more Trade Blotters and click the <span class="Strong">Add Note</span> button within the Trade Blotter toolbar to open the Add Note window that enables users to select a note that is available within a list of predefined notes, or to enter a note that is relevant for describing the progress of the Trade Blotters(s).</p>
        <p class="Body">The type of note that you can add depends on the Trade Blotter(s) that you selected. Different Trade Blotters support different note options (for example, some Trade Blotters do not support adding free text, or do not support all of the predefined note options). </p>
        <p class="Body">When you add a note to more than one Trade Blotter at the same time, you only see those options that are supported by all selected Trade Blotters types. If you require an option that is not supported by one of the selected Trade Blotters, try selecting the Blotters one at a time. </p>
        <p class="Procedure">To select a predefined note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the arrow at the end of the available field to view the complete list of predefined notes that are configured for your RCM.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You can select any existing note and then add or edit text according to your needs, or you can choose to directly type into the available field.</li>
        </ul>
