        <p class="Body">Each module, and the selected views and filters used for that module, generate lists of items that are appropriate for the task that is being performed. For example, selecting <span class="Strong">My Items</span> from the View drop-down menu in the Work Items tab generates a list of items that are assigned to you. Similarly, when you open the Reports module, selecting Unassigned Reports from the Views activity bar of this tab generates a list of all unassigned reports.</p>
