        <h1><a name="_Toc489949684"></a>Adjust the Order of Prioritized Rules</h1>
        <p class="Body">This option enables you to quickly redefine a specific rule’s priority number. It is relevant only to rules that have an order number.<br />For example, a rule with the priority number 4 should be redefined to be a rule with priority number 2.</p>
        <p class="Procedure">To adjust the order of prioritized rules:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Select the rule with Priority number 2.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>On the Rules toolbar, click the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Adjust the Order of Prioritized.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 25px;height: 19px;" /> icon that is next to <span class="Strong">Order</span>. The rule’s order number has now been changed to 3.</li>
            <li>Select the same rule that now has priority number 3 and click the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Adjust the Order of Prioritized.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 25px;height: 19px;" /> icon that is next to <span class="Strong">Order</span>. The rule’s order number has now been changed to 4.</li>
        </ol>
