        <p class="Body">The options that appear in the toolbar depend on the permissions assigned to the currently logged on user and on the requirements of each type of list. For example, some lists may support the addition of a new item to the setting, others may only support editing information within a selected row, while other settings may not support addition or editing. </p>
        <p class="Body">You can select an entry within the setting in order to perform any of the standard operations that appear in the toolbar. Some actions also support selecting multiple entries.</p>
