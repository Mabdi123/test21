            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/The Work Items Widget Bar.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">According to your organization's settings the widget bar may include some or all of the following options: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard search options: The <span class="Strong">Filter by:</span> feature enables you to filter the current list to show only those items that contain the information of interest. The <span class="Strong">Reset </span>button removes all the filtering and sorting definitions that you have added. You can enter any string (letters or numbers) in the available field and click <span class="Strong">Go</span> to search the current list for that string. All rows that contain the entered string appear within the list area. Clicking <span class="Strong">Refresh</span> removes the search filter and updates the display to show all items within the list, with no filter applied. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Predefined actions may have been defined by your organization. To use a specific action, select it from the drop-down menu and click the <span class="Strong">Execute</span> button.</li>
