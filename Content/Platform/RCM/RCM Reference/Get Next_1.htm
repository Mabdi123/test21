        <p class="Body">The Get Next functionality enables you to perform an action which fetches the next case item that you should process instead of going over the list of available items and selecting a specific case item. It provides a quicker method for assigning a work item via a predefined logic and filtering criteria. </p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">Your organization has the option to change the names of the Get Next actions and therefore they may be displayed with a different action link name. </p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">This feature may not be enabled by your organization and therefore may not appear in the toolbar.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Get Next feature is implemented as a toolbar button for work items as displayed in the following:&#160; </p>

            <li>An error message appears indicating that there are already too many active work items.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The following message appears and one or more work items are assigned to you:</li>
