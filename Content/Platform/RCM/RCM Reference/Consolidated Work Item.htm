        <p class="Body">The Consolidated Work Item (CWI) merges incoming work items that have common criteria, which were defined by your organization. An example of a predefined criterion can be an identical account number: A CWI is configured to consolidate (merge) all work items that have the same account number. When the CWI feature has been enabled and defined by your organization, RCM inspects the incoming work items and consolidates data to the relevant fields of the CWI. The fields of the CWI are consolidated via aggregations that were predefined by the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" />implementer. Example of aggregations for sample fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sum: A CWI may be configured to add the amount values of all incoming work items that have the same account number and display the value in its <span class="Strong">Total Alert</span><span class="Strong">ed Amount</span> field. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Last: Populates the field with the value of the last item that is consolidated. For example, if an address field in a work item is configured via the Last aggregation then the Updated address field of the CWI is always updated with the last work item value of address that was received and consolidated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">The following displays an example of a CWI:</p>

            <p class="Body">The display of the CWI in the example may not resemble the actual display of the CWI that was defined by your organization and may include fields that are not used by your organization.</p>
            <p class="Body">Work Item Consolidation is available for both manual and distributed work items.</p>
