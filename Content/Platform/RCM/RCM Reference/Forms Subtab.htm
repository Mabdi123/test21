        <p class="Body">An outgoing form enables you to complete regulatory forms that can later be filed to a regulatory agency. For example, a SAR or CTR form may be filled in and then filed to FinCEN in accordance with this regulatory agency’s rules and regulations. Your organization may also provide you with customized forms that may be used as questionnaires and other user input. The Forms sub- tab enables you to add/remove Forms to/from the Case, as well as add and view form attachments. </p>
