        <p class="Body">Once you have added all relevant LDAP groups to the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> list of groups, you can continue by synchronizing the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> users list with the LDAP users list. </p>
        <p class="Body">The system only synchronizes the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> list to include those users who are associated with the LDAP groups that you added to the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" />. </p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">Circular references (for example, A is a member of group B and B is a member of group A) are not allowed in LDAP.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Procedure">To synchronize the list of RCM users with the LDAP users:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <span class="Strong">Synchronize Users</span> in order to bring all LDAP users, who are associated with the LDAP groups that you have added, into the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> database.</li>
            <p class="Body">This process may take some time. A message window is displayed when the process finishes, indicating success or failure.</p>
        </ul>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">An external user is added to the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> only if that user is linked to a group and the group is linked to a role. If an external user attempts to login to the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" /> via Single Sign On and they are not linked to a group that has a role then they will not be able to login to the <MadCap:variable name="RCM Actimize.ProductCode" />.</p>
