        <h1><a name="_Toc489949625"></a>Add Multiple Conditions to a Query</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can create complex queries by adding multiple conditions to a query separated by the AND and OR operators. By default every new condition has the AND operator. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To change a condition to OR, click on the AND link. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>To change an OR back to AND click on its link. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">You can combine multiple conditions in a single query using the AND and OR operators. </p>
        <p class="Body">

        <p class="Body">However, only the following variations are supported:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using AND operators for all conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Using OR operators to divide the conditions into a few sets when all conditions in each set use the AND operator.</li>
        </ul>
