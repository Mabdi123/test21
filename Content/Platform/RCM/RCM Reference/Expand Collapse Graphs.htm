        <h1><a name="_Toc489949653"></a>Expand/Collapse Graphs</h1>
        <p class="Body">You can collapse and expand graphs as follows.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Expand Collapse Graphs.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 458px;height: 266px;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">The plus ('+') icon may be displayed on the top right corner of a node. This icon indicates that the node is also part of external graphs not directly related to the graph that is being displayed. The plus icon includes the tooltip: <span class="Strong">Click to expand this node’s related graphs</span>. After clicking the '+' icon all the external graphs that you have permission to view and are related to the selected node are loaded and merged into a base graph that is displayed on the canvas. Newly displayed Nodes may also include the '+' icon indicating that they are also expandable.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can only click one '+' icon at a time and you cannot expand the graphs of two or more nodes simultaneously.</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">The graph is limited to the number of nodes that are allowed to be displayed. This limitation is defined by your organization. If the graphs that are to be expanded exceed the maximum number of nodes that may be displayed then an error message is displayed.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Expand Collapse Graphs_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 342px;height: 82px;" /><br />If no graph can be expanded due to the limit on the number of nodes that are allowed to be displayed then the following message is displayed:<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Expand Collapse Graphs_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 415px;height: 85px;" /></p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">The minus ('-') icon displayed on the top right corner of a node indicates that graphs related to the node have been expanded and that the collapse action may be executed by clicking on this icon.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Expand Collapse Graphs_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 385px;height: 235px;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">When you click on the '-' icon, all the external graphs that were expanded by clicking this Node’s ‘+’ icon are removed from the “base graph”. However, if any graph being removed contains a node that other still visible graphs share, then those nodes remain on the canvas. After clicking on the '-' icon it turns back to the '+' icon.</p>
        <p class="Body">Other nodes in the graph may point to the same external graph. When one of the nodes is collapsed, then these nodes are also updated and display the '+' icon.</p>
        <p class="Body">If a node in graph A was expanded to graph B, and a Node in graph B was expanded to graph C then when you click the '-'' icon for the Node in graph A, graph C is collapsed followed by graph B.</p>
        <p class="Body">Links are not merged during the Expand/Collapse process of a specific node. </p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">A Node's attributes may change once it is collapsed or expanded. For example, a different address attribute may appear for the same Node when it is collapsed from an expanded graph.</p>
            <p class="Body">The Node keeps displaying the '+' icon until all of its external graphs are expanded. The minus icon is displayed only when there are no remaining graphs that can be expanded.</p>
            <p class="Body">The Undo the last action (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Reference/Expand Collapse Graphs_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 11px;height: 11px;" />) of the drawing toolbar does not affect the expand or collapse actions.</p>

        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">To group multiple items, press <span class="Strong">Ctrl</span> and click to select multiple nodes and move them as a group. You can also click on the canvas to group items that can then be moved as a group. </p>
