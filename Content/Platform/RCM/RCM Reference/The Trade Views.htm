        <p class="Body">Click a specific Trade to progress to one of the following views:</p><span class="Strong">Trade Summary view </span>
        <p class="Body">This is the default view of Trade Blotter Types that have Trade Summary definitions. The RCM implementer of your organization decides which blotter types have Trade Summary definitions. The Trade Details view displayed the Risk Based Trade details in the same way regular trades are displayed.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Trade Summary view provides advanced criteria for signing off a trade. An average score of a pre defined list of hierarchy fields (defined by implementer on the blotter type) is compared to a threshold that is predefined by the Implementer. All trades that exceed this threshold must be reviewed before the blotter can be signed off.</p>
