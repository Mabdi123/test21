        <p class="Body">When a condition/constraint is crossed out, it is no longer part of the sequence. However, it can be easily returned to the sequence by removing the cross out line from it.</p>
        <p class="Procedure">To cross out a condition/constraint:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Hover over the condition/constraint that you want to remove and then clear the checkbox next to it.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>To return the condition/constraint to the sequence, hover over the crossed out condition/constraint and then select the checkbox next to it.</li>
        </ol>
