        <h1><a name="_Toc489949763"></a>Effect on Policy Manager Rules</h1>
        <p class="Body">Your organization may define Platform Lists that are available for use in the Policy Manager. In this scenario, a Policy Manager rule can be defined which includes an exists in list function that refers to the selected list.</p>
        <p class="Body">The results of a rule, which includes an exists in list function, change when you modify a list to include/exclude host values. If the list uses host values then a rule is triggered when the searched value exists in the tenant's items or in the host's items. If the list does not include host values then the rule is triggered when the searched value exists in the tenant's items.</p>
