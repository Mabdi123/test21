        <h1><a name="_Toc489949616"></a>DART Query Types</h1>
        <p class="Body">The following are the types of queries you can create and manage using DART.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple queries</li>
            <p class="Body">In a simple query, the data of a selected data source is filtered by indicating criteria of interest based on a specified time period and at least one of the available columns (fields) within the data source. </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Complex queries</li>
            <p class="Body">In a complex query, multiple query conditions are defined, separated by the AND or OR operators. By default every new condition includes the AND operator.</p>
            <p class="Body">Click the <span class="Strong">AND</span>/<span class="Strong">OR</span> link to change an OR back to an AND. You can combine multiple conditions in a single query, however only the following variations are supported:</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Using AND operators for all conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Using OR operators to divide the conditions into a few sets when all conditions in each set use the AND operator.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Multi-field queries that contain sub-queries</p>
        <p class="Body">In a multi-field condition, you can add a sub-query to the current query. </p>
