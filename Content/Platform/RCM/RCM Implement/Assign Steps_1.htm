        <h3 class="NoNumber">Maintain Steps within the RCM Designer</h3>
        <p class="Body">All Steps that are available for assignment to a Case Type are written to the Steps Table within the RCM database. Steps within this table may be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Common Steps</span> – These are automatically assigned to all Case Types.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Available Steps</span> – These are steps which can, optionally, be assigned to any Case Type using the RCM Designer Case Types <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span> Assigned Predefined Steps page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">These notes are originally defined in the Case Steps page in the Case Configuration tab. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Predefined Notes.htm#_Ref122344702" class="ParaTextOnly">Predefined Notes</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <p class="Body">The following window enables you to assign the step workflow.</p>

        <p>The Steps Workflow tab enables you to select one of the following options.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Strong">Select</span><span class="Strong"> Step Workflow Definition</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Body">Assign a predefined workflow to the alert type – this option is achieved by selecting a workflow from the <span class="Strong">Step Workflow Definition</span> drop-down menu. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Set Up Step Workflows for.htm#_Ref174786650" class="ParaTextOnly">Set Up Step Workflows for Cases</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="Strong">Workflow Assignments Rule Table</span> allows having more than one workflow for the same Case Type. The case instance can be mapped to different workflows not only by the Case Type but also by the Business Unit. For example, a case instance from a Case Type that was opened on BU1 can have one workflow while another case instance from the same Case Type can be linked to BU2 and a different workflow. The prioritization of the Workflow Assignments Rules avoids any mapping conflicts (e.g., a BU on one hierarchy appearing on another hierarchy). </p>
        <p class="Body">To define <span class="Strong">Workflow Assignments Rules</span> do the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the Add new workflow rule icon <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Assign the Workflow of Steps_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 19px;height: 20px;" />.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Select a workflow for the rule from the drop-down menu.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Select whether or not to include descendants and map a BU hierarchy to the Workflow Rule. Note that a workflow is associated with a case/work item according to the initial BU and it does not change if the case/work item is changed afterwards.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If you selected to include descendants in the previous column then select the BU hierarchy for the rule.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the Business Unit that will be mapped to the rule.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Add additional rules and then use the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Assign the Workflow of Steps_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 12px;height: 12px;" /> and <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Assign the Workflow of Steps_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 12px;height: 12px;" /> icons to prioritize the rules.</li>

        <p class="Body">Add any Available Step to the list of Selected Steps for the alert type that you are defining.

        <p class="Body">To add a step to the list of selected steps, select the step that you want to add from the list of Available Steps and click <span class="Strong">Add</span>. The step is added to the list of Selected Steps.</p>
