            <MadCap:keyword term="Purge Policy">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>The Purge policy determines when the materialized report should be purged (i.e., when the materialized file is removed from the RCM). This is different from user deletion of a report. When a user deletes a report, the report remains on-line for the amount of time stipulated by the archive policy. The materialized instance of the report is only removed from the system according to the Purge policy.</p>
