        <ul>
            <li>Out-of-the-box Best Practices that are released with RCM Designer. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Additional self developed Best Practices. This describes how to create additional Best Practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Best Practices are located in the RCM Designer bin folder </p>
        <p class="Body">(e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Actimize\CaseManagerDesigner\Bin\Best Practices). Each Best Practice is composed of a JSON file and a folder that has the same name.
