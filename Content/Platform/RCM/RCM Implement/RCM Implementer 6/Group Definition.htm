        <h1><a name="_Toc500234275"></a>Group Definition</h1>
        <p class="Body">Since there are several widgets created by a single metadata definition, they should be collectively referenced. Inside the XML there is a tag that allows the definition of the group. If there is no group defined, then a name is automatically generated. There cannot be two widget renderers with the same group in a single layout. In case there are two widgets with the same group under the same layout, then the user will get an error when expanding the secondary layout </p>
