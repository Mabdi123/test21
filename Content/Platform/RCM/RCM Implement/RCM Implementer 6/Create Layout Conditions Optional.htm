        <p class="Body">The Layouts tab enables you to define and format layout conditions. A layout condition is a single Boolean expression that determines whether its layout must be used or not. </p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Create Layout Conditions Optional.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 577px;height: 172px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">Click the <span class="Strong">new Layout</span> icon and define an identifier, description and condition for the layout. The first layout in the table has the highest display priority. The priority is the order in which the conditions are evaluated. The first layout condition that is true is the one that is used. For example if the first of three condition returns false and the second condition returns true, then the layout that is used and displayed will be the layout with the second priority. (The third condition is not evaluated).</p>
        <p class="Body">If you would like to display all conditions that return true, select the <span class="Strong">Enable multiple layouts</span> checkbox.</p>
        <p class="ConvertNote">NOTE:</p>
        <p class="Body">It is possible to add a default layout by adding the word <span class="Strong">true</span> in the condition field.</p>
