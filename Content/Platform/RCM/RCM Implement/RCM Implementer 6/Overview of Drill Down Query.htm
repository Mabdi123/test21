        <h1><a name="_Ref397253972"></a><a name="_Toc500234236"></a>Overview of Drill-Down Query Setup</h1>
        <p class="ConvertNote">NOTE:</p>
        <p class="Body">Changing a Drill-Down Query or any parameter associated with a query must be done in co-ordination with definitions within the AIS Model that generates the Query.</p>
        <p class="Body">A Drill-Down Query is an SQL Query that is used in order to expand the Alert Details. Drill-Down Queries are defined during modeling and are written to the <span class="Strong">drill_down_queries </span>table within the RCM database. All queries, that are already defined, automatically appear within the RCM Designer Queries module. You can view these queries, and certified AIS implementers can use this tool to facilitate the editing of existing queries.</p>
        <p class="Body">Defining drill-down queries requires the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing a name and description for this Query</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Selecting the appropriate connector </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Entering the Query</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding parameters to the Query</li>
        </ul>
