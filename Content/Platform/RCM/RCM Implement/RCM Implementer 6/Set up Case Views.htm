        <p class="ConvertNote">NOTE:</p>
        <p class="Body">You must logout and then login to RCM in order to view the changes that you made in a view.</p>
        <p class="Body">The RCM Designer enables implementers to set up the Case Views that are used within the RCM Application. Each view is usually composed of Built In Fields and Custom Fields.</p>
        <p class="Body">There are two types of Case Views:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">System Views:</span> Views that are readily available after the RCM Designer installation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Defined Views: </span>Defined Views that can be added by the implementer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Setting up Defined Case Views requires the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing a name, description for this Case View</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Defining the fields, which will be viewed, and the format of their display</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Defining the default sort of the Cases View, and/or defining a filter for it via an SQL query</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Saving the newly configured view</li>
        </ul>
