        <p class="Body">RCM uses two types of fields when identifying objects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">ID</span> – An internally generated integer, used by RCM for data integrity</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Iden</span><span class="Strong">tifier</span> – An externally defined string, used for interfacing with external systems and migrating data between RCM installations</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Both are unique, but behave differently:</p>
        <p class="Body">An ID never changes, but is limited to the scope of a single RCM installation</p>
        <p class="Body">An identifier can change, though changing it may break link to external systems</p>
        <p class="Body">Internal IDs are specific to every RCM instance, and therefore they are not interchangeable between RCMs, nor can they be copied between RCM instances. Due to these facts, you should never save internal IDs in files/database outside of RCM. Instead, when you need to save references to RCM objects (such as business units) outside of RCM, store identifiers.</p>
        <p class="Body">Older RCM APIs make use of Ids, thus they are exposed. These APIs may be phased out in later versions of RCM.</p>
