        <h1>Deadline Recalculations</h1>
        <p class="Body">In certain cases there are changes that affect calendar calculations for step deadlines. These include BU changes and platform list data changes (adding and removing dates), </p><span class="Strong">Example (using the hierarchies above)</span>
        <p class="Body">Work item assigned BU5, and the system selects <span class="Strong">Calendar 3</span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">The step deadlines for the workflow of this work item are configured to business days based on calendar 3. If between two steps the BU for this item is changed to BU 9, then the deadline for the next step is caluculated according to calendar 4. This recalculation only applies to workflow step deadlines and not global deadlines, which remain as originally configured.</p>
