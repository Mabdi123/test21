        <h1><a name="_Toc500234320"></a>Export Dependent Objects</h1>
        <p class="Body">Some of the objects that can be exported have dependent objects. For example, a specific alert view depends on alert settings such as built in fields. The RCM Designer provides you with the option to automatically include the dependent object(s) of the object(s) that you select for export. This is achieved by selecting the checkbox of this option.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">If this checkbox is cleared then when you select an object that has dependent object(s), a three dots icon appears at the end of the object’s name. Clicking on the icon opens a menu that enables you to select the dependent object(s) you want to export. If you want to select more than one dependent object then select the objects while pressing the Ctrl key. You can also click the Select All button at bottom of the menu to export all the dependent object(s).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">If an object is not exported with all its objects then it appears with a red marking on its icon (for example, <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Export Dependent Objects_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 13px;height: 14px;" />.)</p>
