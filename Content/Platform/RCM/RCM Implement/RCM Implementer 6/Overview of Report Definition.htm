        <h1><a name="_Ref396827505"></a><a name="_Toc500234165"></a>Overview of Report Definition Setup</h1>
        <p class="Body">The workflow for setting up Report definitions includes the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating Required Report Templates using an external application, such as the JReport Designer</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">To set up reports for the RCM, there must be at least one report template that was previously defined. RCM reports may be defined using the JReport Designer, or may exist as external files or external URLs.</p>
        <p class="Body">When reports are created using JReport Enterprise Manager, each JReport definition must include a .cls file and a .cat file, which are uploaded within the RCM Designer. There may be additional files generated for the report (e.g., bitmap files that are included within the report). All files that are generated for a report by the JReport Designer must be maintained within the same folder together with the cls and cat files.</p>
        <p class="Body">For detailed information about defining Report Templates using the JReport Designer, refer to the <span class="Emphasis">RCM</span> <span class="Emphasis">Self </span><span class="Emphasis">Developer Guide</span>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting up the Report Definitions using the RCM Designer</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Once you have created a report that you want to make available for the RCM users, you can setup the RCM Report Definitions using the RCM Designer.</p>
        <p class="Body">The reports that are available within the RCM can be organized according to categories (e.g. Management Reports, Supervision Reports, etc.). Once a report is uploaded to the relevant RCM category you can map any parameters that are included within this report to Business Unit Attributes (that you define using the Business Units tab within the RCM Designer – see <MadCap:xref href="Define Business Unit Attributes.htm#_Ref99345436" class="ParaTextOnly">Define Business Unit Attributes</MadCap:xref>).</p>
