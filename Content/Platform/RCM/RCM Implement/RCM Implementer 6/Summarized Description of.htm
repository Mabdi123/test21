        <h1><a name="_Ref396812950"></a><a name="_Toc500234086"></a>Summarized Description of the Consolidation Process</h1>
        <p class="Body">When a TWI is distributed or created, RCM verifies whether or not it needs to be consolidated into a CWI:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>RCM verifies whether or not this TWI has a consolidated relation defined in a CWI. See <MadCap:xref href="Define the Relation Attributes.htm#_Ref351557258" class="ParaTextOnly">Define the Relation Attributes for the Alert Type</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>If a consolidated relation exists then the consolidation process continues</li>
            <li>If a consolidated relation does not exist then a TWI is generated in RCM without any consolidation action. Note that if the TWI is defined as Transient then it is not generated.</li>
            <li>RCM reads the condition expression defined in the consolidation key target field.<p class="Body"><img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Summarized Description of.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 630px;height: 39px;" /></p><p class="Body">See also <MadCap:xref href="Configure a Target Field.htm#_Ref351557724" class="ParaTextOnly">Configure a Target Field.</MadCap:xref></p><ul start="1"><li>If this condition is true or no condition exists, the consolidation process continues.</li><li>If the condition is false, the TWI is generated in RCM without any consolidation action.</li></ul></li>
            <li>RCM finds the potential CWIs into which this TWI will be consolidated (there can be only one CWI per relation). Therefore, RCM searches per relation for the list of potential CWIs based on the consolidation key field and the consolidation criteria. A consolidation relation is the relation between TWI type A and CWI type B, where CWI type B is set as a consolidation target. Consolidation criteria are the conditions defined in the Consolidation Criteria tab. See <MadCap:xref href="Define the Relation Attributes.htm#_Ref351558442" class="ParaTextOnly">Define the Relation Attributes for the Alert Type </MadCap:xref>and <MadCap:xref href="Configuring Consolidation.htm#_Ref351558218" class="ParaTextOnly">Configuring Consolidation Criteria</MadCap:xref>. RCM does the following for each consolidation relation when it is provided with a TWI that includes a consolidation key:<ul><li>RCM finds a CWI that matches both the consolidation key and the consolidation criteria.</li></ul><ul start="1"><li>If a CWI is not found then RCM creates a new CWI.</li></ul><ul start="2"><li>If one CWI is found, RCM uses it.</li></ul><ul start="3"><li>If more than one CWI is found, RCM uses the first CWI according to the sorting order defined in the Consolidation Criteria tab.</li></ul></li>
            <li>RCM creates a relation between the TWI and CWI.</li>
            <li>CWI field aggregation is performed according to the definitions in the CWI Alert Type fields tab and the Related Item Types tab. See <MadCap:xref href="Configure the Built In Fields.htm#_Ref351559081" class="ParaTextOnly">Configure the Built In Fields</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="Configure the Custom Fields.htm#_Ref351559090" class="ParaTextOnly">Configure the Custom Fields</MadCap:xref>.<ul start="1"><li>If the condition is true or no condition exists then the aggregated CWI field value is updated, based on the defined aggregation.</li></ul><ul start="2"><li>If the condition is false then the aggregated CWI field is not affected by the current consolidated TWI.</li></ul></li>
