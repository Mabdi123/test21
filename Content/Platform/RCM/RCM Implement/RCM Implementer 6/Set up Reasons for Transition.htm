        <p class="Body">Before defining the reasons, you must create and fill in at least one list of reasons in the Platforms List module. For more information on Platform Lists refer to <MadCap:xref href="Setting up Platform Lists.htm#_Ref421465877" class="ParaTextOnly">Setting up Platform Lists </MadCap:xref>and the Platform Lists chapter in the <span class="Emphasis">RCM</span><span class="Emphasis"> Reference </span><span class="Emphasis">G</span><span class="Emphasis">uide</span>.</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">The reason feature is related to the alert, not to the current step. If a reason has been previously selected when changing from step A to step B, (meaning the alert already has a reason assigned to it), then it is not mandatory anymore. It is mandatory only if the user has not selected any reason previously.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Procedure">To setup the reasons for a transition:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li> Select the reasons List checkbox and select a Reason List from the drop-down menu. These lists are created via the Platform Lists module. Click the Refresh button to view an updated list. Click the Open (<img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Set up Reasons for Transition_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 18px;height: 19px;" />) button in order to view and optionally modify the selected Reason list.</li>
            <li>Select the reason code field and reason name field from the fields of the selected Platform List. These are the Platform List’s view fields. Only string fields can be selected.</li>
            <li>Optionally, select the mandatory checkbox in order to make it mandatory for the user to select a reason in order to move to the next step in the workflow.</li>
            <li>Optionally, filter the reasons that can be viewed by the user via the filtering table.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">For platform lists that require four eye review, only approved reasons are displayed to the user that changes the step and selects a reason.</p>
