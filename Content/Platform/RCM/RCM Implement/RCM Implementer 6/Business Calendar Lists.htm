        <p class="Body">The following platform lists are automatically installed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Business Calendar – Days</span>: Allows you to designate non-business days for a specific calendar. Includes the following fields.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="Body">Selecting one of the checkboxes enables you to:</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Strong">Four Eye Review</span> – Enforce an approval for every new item that is added to the relevant business calendar list by the RCM user. Only the approved items are counted in the Business Days calculation.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Strong">Support multi-tenant mode</span> – Support multi-tenant mode for every new item that is added to the relevant business calendar list by the RCM user. This checkbox is selected by default for both calendar lists.</p>
        <p class="ConvertNote">NOTE:</p>
        <p class="Body">In a multi tenant environment, if one of the calendar lists (or both) support host values, then the calculation takes the host configuration into account in the list that supports the host values.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Strong">Support test values</span> – Support tuning values for every new record that is added to the relevant business calendar list by the RCM user. Items in test status are not counted in the Business Days calculation.</p>
