        <h1><a name="_Toc500234127"></a>maxNumberOfActiveItems Parameter</h1>
        <p class="Body">This parameter describes the maximum number of active work items that can be assigned to a user at one time based on the number of work items listed in the alert view specified above.</p>
        <p class="Body">If the actual number of work items in the alert view is greater than the value of the parameter, then calling Get Next results in a failure with the following notification message: Too many work items or alerts are currently being processed. Cannot assign a new item.</p>
        <p class="Body">If grouping is enabled then each group of work items is counted as a singular work item for the purpose of checking whether or not the maximum number of active items has been exceeded. work items without a group (i.e., their grouping field is NULL) are considered as an individual work item.</p>
