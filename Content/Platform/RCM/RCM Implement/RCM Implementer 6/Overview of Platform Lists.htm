        <p class="Body">There are two types of platform lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lists that are based on AIS Lists: These lists that are originally defined by the AIS user. The RCM Designer enables connection to AIS lists, setting their view definitions, adding additional fields and optionally importing/exporting the related metadata. These platform lists are created by using the AIS Visual Modeler, and the Designer receives the list definitions from the AIS.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Lists that are defined in the RCM: These lists are completely defined via the RCM Designer and do not require a connection to AIS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ConvertNote">NOTE:</p>
        <p class="Body">You have the option to change the type of platform list after it is defined.</p>
        <p class="Body">The RCM UI user can then add/remove data to the list and optionally use a list in a rule of the Policy Manager. New items in the list can be approved or disapproved by the authorized RCM user. Platform lists also enable the user to create rules based on lists by using the “Exists in List” operator and selecting a relevant platform list.</p>
        <p class="Body">The RCM Designer allows modifying lists, and adding view-related metadata. </p>
        <p class="ConvertNote">NOTE:</p>
        <p class="Body">When importing platform lists in selective mode, the description and view fields are retained. </p>
