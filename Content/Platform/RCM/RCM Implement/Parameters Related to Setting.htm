        <h1><a name="_Ref397428186"></a><a name="_Toc500234315"></a>Parameters Related to Setting up the Distributed Cache</h1>
        <p class="Body">RCM uses a cache system in order to improve performance when accessing global application data such as Alert Types, Alert Views, etc. In a distributed environment this cache is mirrored in all RCM instances using JBoss distributed cache.</p>
        <p class="Body">Once you have deployed the RCM s on each of the machines within the distributed environment, edit the <span class="Strong">acm.ini</span> file for each deployment in order to switch from a standalone to a distributed cache environment.</p>
        <p class="Procedure">To set up a distributed cache:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>
                <p>Remove the comment characters from the following lines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>actimize.cache = distributed</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>actimize.cache.distribution.host=239.0.0.0</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>actimize.navigation.cache.distribution.port=45559</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p class="Body">Note that all the machines must be configured to use the same ports.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>If there are other systems on your subnet that are using the multicast IP and port that are included in this section, then you should change them. If you decide to change these values, use a Class D IP address. Class D address falls within the range of 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">This configuration does not work when machines are in different subnets.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">When the RCM servers are spread across a number of WANs (subnets), you must also configure following parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the comment characters from the parameter actimize.cache.wan as shown in the following example:<p class="Code">actimize.cache.wan = true</p></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the comment characters from the parameter actimize.cache.wan.machines and enter the local machines IP addresses as the values. <br />Note that the list of distributed machines must start with the address of the local machine with the RCM server.<br />For example:<p class="Code">actimize.cache.wan.machines = 212.64.45.54,212.64.45.44 </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>
