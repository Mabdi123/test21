        <h1>getLastActionWidget</h1>
        <p class="Body">Returns the Widget object whose action was the last one to be called. For example, if a page stores two Widgets – “a” and “b” – with the same action “doSomething”, and the implementer wants to know in the doSomething code which Widget the action was called from then this method obtains the relevant Widget.</p>
