        <h1>Save the Selection for Export</h1>
        <p class="Body">The export wizard provides you with the option to save the objects you want to export to a file and then load them later on. This option is useful when a newly created object needs to be exported together with additional objects that were exported previously. Instead of selecting all the objects again with the newly created object, you can select to load the file that defines these previously defined exported objects and then only select the newly created object with it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To save the objects that are selected for export to a file, click the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Saving the Selection for Export.png" class="Icon" /> icon. This file can be loaded in a future export procedure by clicking the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Saving the Selection for Export_1.png" class="Icon" />icon and selecting the previously saved file.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>After you have selected the objects for export click the Next button. This action moves you to the Export File Path screen</li>
        </ul>
