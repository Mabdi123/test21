        <p class="Body">When a report is archived the materialized report instance, along with supporting data such as notes, is copied to an external file system. (Report instance materialization is when the report becomes a static file managed by RCM. A report instance must first be materialized before archiving is possible.) Once archived, the files are managed by a third party document management system or as part of other file system backup processes.</p>
