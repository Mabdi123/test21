        <p class="Body">The RCM Designer is delivered with a Default Policy that can be selected for any report. It is also possible to create a new policy according to the requirements for specific types of reports. Each Policy is comprised of a set of individual policies. Assigning a selected policy to a report means that you are assigning all of the individual policies that were set for the selected policy.</p>
