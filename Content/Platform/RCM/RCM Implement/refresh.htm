        <p class="Body">This function refreshes the widget data. It does not run the query nor resets the grid sorting state. It reloads the grid in case the backend data has changed. The backend data refers to what the DB table stores. These are the related records that the query is supposed to fetch. </p>
        <p class="Body">The function reruns the last query. If the query in the RCM has already been changed (for example, by adding or editing conditions) then the results are different from the results of clicking the Go button.</p>
