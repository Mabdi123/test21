        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">This feature is available as part of the ERCM license that allows the creation of Drill-Down Queries.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">A Drill-Down Query is an SQL Query that is used in order to expand the Alert Details. Drill-Down Queries are defined during modeling and are written to the <span class="Strong">drill_down_queries </span>table within the RCM database. All queries, that are already defined, automatically appear within the RCM Designer Queries module. You can view these queries, and certified AIS implementers can use this tool to facilitate the editing of existing queries.</p>
