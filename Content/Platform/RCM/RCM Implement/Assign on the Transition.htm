        <p class="ConvertNote">NOTE:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The automatic transition on touch setting overrides this definition. Meaning if you have selected automatic transition for a step, and one of the “touches” is assign, then the step will automatically change and the assignment will not hold.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Recalling or resetting a transition does not reset the assignment of the transition</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If a transition is done via a plugin call then the alert is assigned to the user performing the step change action.</li>
