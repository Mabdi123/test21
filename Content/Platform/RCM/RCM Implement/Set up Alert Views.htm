        <p class="Body">The RCM Designer enables implementers to set up the Alert (Work Item) Views that are used within the RCM application. Each view is usually composed of Built In Fields and Custom Fields.</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p class="Body">You must logout and then login to RCM in order to view the changes that you made in a view.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">There are two types of Alert Views:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">System Views:</span> Views that are readily available after the RCM Designer installation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Strong">Defined Views: </span>Defined views that can be added by the implementer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Setting up defined alert views involves the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing a name, description for this alert view</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Defining the fields, which will be viewed, and the format of their display.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Defining the default sort of the alerts view, and/or defining a filter for it via an SQL query.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Saving the newly configured view.</li>
