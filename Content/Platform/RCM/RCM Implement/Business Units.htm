        <h1><a name="_Toc500233994"></a>Business Units</h1>
        <p class="Body">Each Hierarchy presents the relations between individual Business Units, according to the logic of that hierarchy. These Business units are represented by nodes within a tree structure (parent and children nodes). Each node within a tree is a distinct Business Unit (whether it is a parent or child). In the Geographical Hierarchy shown above, USA is considered one Business Unit and NY is considered a different Business Unit. Similarly, in the Functional Hierarchy (shown above), USA AML is one business unit and NY AML is a different business unit. Note that, while most of the business units within our two examples are different, the lowest level includes the same business units for both Hierarchies. In other words, the business unit NYE Branch 26000 is the same business unit whether you approach it from the Geographic hierarchy or from the Functional Hierarchy. If attributes are assigned to this business unit, these attributes are applicable regardless of the hierarchy in which this business unit is used (see <MadCap:xref href="Attributes.htm#_Ref99337355" class="ParaTextOnly">Attributes</MadCap:xref> for more information about this feature).</p>
        <p class="Body">Our example of the Geographic Hierarchy, when designed within the RCM Designer, would appear as follows:</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">Our example of the Functional Hierarchy would appear as follows.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Business Units_1.png" style="width: 165px;height: 284px;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">Each time you define a Business Unit for a hierarchy, that unit is automatically available for use within any other hierarchy that you design. Consequently, as you add new business units to a new hierarchy, these business units are added to the Business Unit pane on the left side of the screen, as shown in the following example:</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Platform/RCM/RCM Implementer Guide 6/Business Units_2.png" style="width: 192px;height: 250px;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">You can create a new business unit either while you are designing a hierarchy, or by itself using the icon toolbar within the Business Unit pane. If you choose to create a library of business units first, these will be available for any hierarchy that you subsequently create. These Business Units are only visible within the RCM application options after they are assigned to a Hierarchy.</p>
