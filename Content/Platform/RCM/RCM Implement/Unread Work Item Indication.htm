        <p class="Body">A work item that appears in bold characters indicates that it has not been read yet. The unread status appears when the work item is created or assigned.</p>

        <p class="Body">A work item appears as read when one of the following actions occurs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is assigned to a specific user and is viewed by that user.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>It is unassigned and is viewed by any user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">You may also configure the RCM to return a work item to its unread state- when it is updated by someone other than its owner (unassigned user).  </p>
        <p class="Body">This configuration is done by enabling the parameter actimize.alerts.setUnreadAfterNonOwnerUpdates. The parameter can be enabled in the Config Parameters tab of admin.jsp</p>

        <p class="Body">It supports the option of resetting work items as unread after they have been updated by someone other than their user who is not the owner of the items. </p>
